## 🛰️ System Features
The environment includes several advanced visual and technical modules:

### 1. System Status HUD
Located in the bottom-left corner, the HUD provides persistent telemetry:
- **CPU**: Real-time load fluctuation.
- **NET**: Connection status (Always ENCRYPTED).
- **LOCALE**: Current site language (EN_US or SO_639).

### 2. Visual Modules
- **CRT Overlay**: A subtle flicker and scanline effect to mimic 80s hardware.
- **Glitch Headers**: Hovering over section titles (e.g., "RESEARCH") triggers a data-corruption animation.
- **Background Grain**: A tactile texture applied across the dark-mode theme.

### 3. Heritage Integration
- **Somali Star Map**: Found in the **Science** section. An ASCII representation of constellations with names in Somali (toggle via EN/SO buttons).
- **Full i18n**: Real-time translation of all major UI elements and selected blog posts (e.g., "Welcome").

## 🕵️ Secrets & Advanced Mode
The platform contains hidden paths for inquisitive engineers:
- **Encrypted Files**: Use `tree` to find the location of encrypted data, then use `cat` to decrypt it.
- **Developer Mode**: Run the `unlock` command to shift the site's accent color to gold and reveal a status badge.
